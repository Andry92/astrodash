# astrodash-accuracy

This program calculates accuracy of the spectra classification performed by astrodash.
Astrodash classify the type, age, redshift and host for any supernova spectra.
You can see the accuracy performance of astrodash by screenshots file uploaded.
"Accuracy - 50 elementi per classe.png" screenshot file shows accuracy result extracting 50 random elements per class,
where classes are following supernova type: Ia, Ia-norm, Ia-91T, Ib-norm, IIb, Ic-broad, IIP, IIn.
